Shield bonus attributes and resource costs can be edited in XComshield.ini
XComClassData determines which classes can equip the shield
ConvShield is a single unreal package supplying the model for each shield item. There is only 1 shield model in use.

If you do not have Shen's Last Gift, Bulwark will not be on the shield. If you still want to use the mod, you may want to
edit the bonuses. Probably at least give +1 armor to each tier of the shield.
